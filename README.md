# Lively react test page

This is an example of how to setup a headless Lively environment for scripting a
web page.

Live version runs at:
  https://lively-next.org/users/robert/react-dev-page/index.html

The `livelify-web.js` script was [packaged](https://gist.github.com/rksm/c0019af0d03e7de29189ff51c080ceb6) based on a current [lively.next installation](https://github.com/LivelyKernel/lively.installer).

You can modify the code and when pressing `Command-S`/ `Control-S` the source
change will be applied using lively.modules.  This means the runtime is updated
without causing a reload. For more info about how this works see
[lively.modules](https://github.com/LivelyKernel/lively.modules).
