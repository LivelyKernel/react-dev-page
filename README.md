# Lively react test page

This is an example of how to setup a headless Lively environment for scripting a
web page.

You can modify the code and when pressing `Command-S`/ `Control-S` the source
change will be applied using lively.modules.  This means the runtime is updated
without causing a reload. For more info about how this works see
[lively.modules](https://github.com/LivelyKernel/lively.modules).
